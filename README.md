# Class Note Taker

## Description

In this challenge I needed to create an application that takes notes. The application requires you to use (Express.js),  back end and will retrieve data from a JSON File. 
In this project I had the opportunity to use a framework system with Express. I use the server side application that meets the requirements to take notes.
